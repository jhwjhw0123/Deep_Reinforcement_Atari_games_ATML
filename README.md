# Deep_Reinforcement_Atari_games_ATML <br />
The codes are for different games and different types of agents: <br />
Part A is for CartPole game, and Part B is for Atari games: Pong, Ms. Pancman and Boxing. <br />

*Codes:* <br /> 
Codes are stored by document names. <br />
In part A because they are on-line learning problems there isn’t a model restore session. If you want to verify the performance in the report, you can simply run the codes in the corresponding file and it will not take a long time. <br />
In part B, B.2 is designed to test the result of the untrained network, and B.3&4 contains the restoring model codes. One can test the performance of the agents by simply run the codes corresponding to the game’s name. Ex: If you want to test Pong, run ‘DQN_Test_Pong.py’. <br />
N.B.: In ubuntu system, character ‘&’ in the file path might not be identified. The solution is simple: change the file name and the corresponding restore path to B3 should definitely work.<br />

*Logs:* <br />
If there is any ‘log’ file in any section of the code file, it will contain the quantitative results of the experiment. You can verify it by simply open it.<br />
